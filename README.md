# 🧪 Komtigma Labs

Welcome to **Komtigma Labs**, the official GitHub profile of **Komisi Tiga HIMTI 2025–2026**.

We’re a student development team focused on applying real-world software engineering practices using the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** model. This profile showcases our collaborative projects, research, and learning tools built with structure, clarity, and purpose.

## 🔄 What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?

**SDLC is a process followed for software building within a software organization.**  
It consists of a precise plan that describes how to develop, maintain, replace, and enhance software. It helps improve **software quality** and the **overall development process**.

---

## 🧩 Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle

### 1️⃣ Planning & Requirement Analysis  
**Question:** _What are the current problems?_  
This is the **foundation phase**. The goal is to understand what the client or business needs.

**Activities:**
- Stakeholder meetings
- Requirement gathering
- Feasibility study

✅ **Outcome:** Project scope, goals, and early risk assessment.

---

### 2️⃣ Defining Requirements  
**Question:** _What do we want?_  
Gathered information is **documented** clearly to define what the system should do.

**Activities:**
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Define functional & non-functional requirements
- Cost/time/resource estimates

✅ **Outcome:** SRS document & clear project scope.

---

### 3️⃣ Designing Architecture  
**Question:** _How will we build it?_  
The team creates a **blueprint**—selecting architecture, tech stack, and data flow.

**Activities:**
- High-level and low-level design
- UI prototypes, data models
- Feedback loops

✅ **Outcome:** Design Specification Document (DSD)

---

### 4️⃣ Developing the Product  
**Question:** _Let’s build it!_  
This is the coding phase. Developers start implementing the design.

**Activities:**
- Writing code
- Version control using Git
- Following code standards

✅ **Outcome:** Working source code & version-controlled repositories

---

### 5️⃣ Testing and Integration  
**Question:** _Does it work as expected?_  
The software is tested for bugs, quality, and compliance with requirements.

**Activities:**
- Unit, integration, and system testing
- Manual & automated testing
- Bug fixing

✅ **Outcome:** Tested and validated product

---

### 6️⃣ Deployment & Maintenance  
**Question:** _Now what?_  
The final product is delivered and monitored in the real environment.

**Activities:**
- Deployment (web/cloud/on-premise)
- Monitoring & bug patching
- Ongoing updates and improvements

✅ **Outcome:** Live, reliable software with ongoing support

---

## 📊 SDLC Models

### 💧 Waterfall Model  
A linear approach — complete one phase before the next begins.

### ⚡ Agile Model  
Iterative, fast-paced releases with user feedback loops.

### 🔁 Iterative Model  
Builds the product through repeated versions and improvements.

### 🌀 Spiral Model  
Combines planning, prototyping, and risk assessment in cycles.
